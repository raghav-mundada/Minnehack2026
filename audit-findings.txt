AUDIT FINDINGS:

1. NAVIGATION ISSUES:
   - NavigationMenu hamburger is md:hidden - invisible on desktop! Need always-visible nav
   - No back button on Dashboard page
   - GroupDetail has back button but no hamburger menu
   - JoinGroup has no navigation at all
   - Home page (logged in) has no menu

2. BACKEND ISSUES:
   - castle.reset only resets castle stats + zombies, does NOT clear app usage (timer counts)
   - appUsage.getToday shows only apps with logged usage, not apps with limits but no usage
   - Dashboard shows "No app usage tracked yet" when limits exist but no usage logged
   - appLimits.set uses onDuplicateKeyUpdate but there's no unique constraint on (userId, appName)

3. BLOCKED PAGE:
   - Override button is tiny Code icon - needs to be more prominent
   - Override doesn't clear app usage data (timer counts)

4. DISPLAY ISSUES:
   - Dashboard shows app usage only from getToday, doesn't show configured limits without usage
   - Need to show ALL configured app limits with their usage (0 if none logged)
   - Progress bars only show for apps with usage, not for all limits

5. QOL MISSING:
   - No confirmation on delete actions
   - Leaderboard/Nudges cards on Dashboard are non-functional (opacity-60)
   - No way to edit existing app limits
   - No indication of which apps have limits set in tracker
